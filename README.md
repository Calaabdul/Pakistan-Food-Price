# Pakistan Food Price Prediction
This project aims to predict the prices of various food items in Pakistan using Machine Learning. Accurate food price predictions can help in decision making for farmers, consumers, and government, leading to better food security and economic stability.
Food prices can fluctuate due to various factors such as weather conditions and economical reasons like inflation, market demand, and supply chain issues. This project uses machine learning to analyze these factors and predict future prices.
